 * Check if 1 is present in the array. If not, you're done and 1 is the answer.
	Replace negative numbers, zeros, and numbers larger than n by 1s.
	Walk along the array. Change the sign of a-th element if you meet number a. 
	Be careful with duplicates : do sign change only once. Use index 0 to save an
	 information about presence of number n since index n is not available.
	Walk again along the array. Return the index of the first positive element.
	If nums[0] > 0 return n.
	If on the previous step you didn't find the positive element in nums, that means that the answer is n + 1.
